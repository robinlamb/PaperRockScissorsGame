# Paper, Rock, Scissors, Game

This is an Android project made in Android Studio.  This is a Paper, Rock, Scissors game that can be played by one or two players using the same device.  A separate Java class figures the game logic given the two choices.  If the game is in one player mode, a random choice is generated by the computer opponent.  This project contains examples of a shared preference file (to store sound on/off preference), and animations stored in XML using both the older Anim class as well as the newer Animator class. This project contains alternative resources in XML to support devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations.
